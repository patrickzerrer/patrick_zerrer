The visual representation of earnings among Pakistani e-gamers highlights the dominance of Dota 2 players, with Sumail Hassan leading by a significant margin. Sumail, prominently depicted in the largest circle, has amassed an impressive $4,070.4K, setting him apart as the top earner in the Pakistani esports scene. His earnings reflect not only his skill and dedication to Dota 2 but also the game's lucrative nature in the esports industry.

Yawar Hassan, another notable Dota 2 player, follows with $630.14K. The chart also includes players from other popular games, such as Tekken 7 and PUBG, with notable earners like Arslan Siddiqui and Atif Butt, earning $366.17K and $243.7K, respectively.

The color-coded circles represent different games, providing a clear visual distinction among the top earners in various gaming genres. This visualization not only emphasizes the significant earnings of these players but also highlights a significant gap in earnings between the top player and the rest of the pack. It will be interesting to see if other Pakistani e-gamers can bridge the earnings gap in the future.
