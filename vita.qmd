## About me

I have been working as a research assistant at the Centre for Media, Communication and Information Research [(ZeMKI)](https://zemki.uni-bremen.de/) at the University of Bremen since April 2020. In the Laboratory for Digital Communication and Information Diversity under the direction of Prof. Dr Cornelius Puschmann, I am dedicated to the systematic investigation of digital media use using quantitative and automated methods (CSS, R, scraping, mobile tracking, etc.).

From December 2017 to February 2020, I worked as a research assistant at the Institute of Communication Science in Jena as part of a DFG project. The research project focused on the investigation of deliberative interactions in online user comments. In my role as a student assistant, I actively supported the data collection and analysis.

Before that, I completed my Master of Arts in Public Communication at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena from October 2017 to February 2020. I had already deepened my interest in social, sociological and political topics during my studies at the University of Passau, where I studied Governance and Public Policy - Political Science from September 2013 to September 2017 and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts.
