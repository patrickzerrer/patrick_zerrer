The aim is to determine the proportion of social media posts on this topic and to examine the behaviour of users."

The research project focused on the investigation of deliberative interactions in online user comments. In my role as a student assistant, I actively supported the data collection and analysis.\nBefore that, I completed my Master of Arts in Public Communication at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena from October 2017 to February 2020.
